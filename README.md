   - if it finds a match, ask to decrypt
   - If it doesn't find a match, ask for user to supply sha3.key file; ask to encrypt
* Encrypt
   - Randomize through two different randomly generated keys
   - Store keys in sha3.keys file and include a sha3 hash
* Dump sha3.key for that independant File.
