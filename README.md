# Algorithm-Encryption

* input File
   - Validate md5 hash of sha256
   - if it finds a match, ask to decrypt
   - If it doesn't find a match, ask for user to supply sha256.key file; ask to encrypt
* Encrypt
   - Randomize through two different randomly generated keys
   - Store keys in sha256.keys file and include a md5 hash
* Dump sha256.key for that independant File.
